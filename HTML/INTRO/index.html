        <h1>Will Venice succumb to the sea</h1>
        <!--Supplement text in November-->
        <p>Venice is a stunning oddity. It is a city built atop around 120 islands, crisscrossed by 177 canals, and is best explored – when on foot at least – via the use of its 391 bridges.<!--Check if the information has changed.--> It is a watery maze of a city, full of tiny footpaths and tucked away squares, hidden museums and secluded, centuries-old churches.</p>
