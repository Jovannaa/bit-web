        <h1>The food America erased</h1>
        <p>On the back patio at Owamni – the Minneapolis, Minnesota, restaurant owned by <b>Sean Sherman</b> and <b>Dana Thompson</b> – the <b><i>late-evening sun</b></i> cast my dessert in a natural spotlight. Marigold-coloured agave squash caramel cascaded slowly down the sides of a sunflower-seed cake the colour of sandstone, and a deep red berry sauce shimmered atop a maple chaga cake so earthy in tone, it felt as though it were plucked from the forest floor.
        <h2>Prvi podnaslov</h2>
        <p>The connection to nature is palpable here, where sweeping views of the <i>Mississippi River</i>, along with curated indigenous plants like prairie dropseed – whose high-protein seeds can be eaten raw or ground into a flour – etch themselves into the landscape like a painting.</p>

        <p>"We named this restaurant Owamni from the Dakota name OwamniYomni, for the waterfall that used to surround this area," said Thompson, a descendant of the Wahpeton Sisseton and Mdewakanton Dakota tribes. "It was said to be as beautiful as Niagara Falls. Spirit Island was the most sacred of the four islands here, and the Dakota and Anishinaabe communities would take their canoes there for ceremony, and women would come from far away just to give birth there."</p>
